# Welcome To Livewire Examples

Here you can find some examples for issues that where created in the Livewire repo or just see how I would build some
 components in Livewire.  

How to get it running locally.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GertjanRoke/livewire-examples.git livewire-examples
cd livewire-examples
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

### Current examples
- Language Validation
- A Form Without Specifying Every Form Element
- Example where Livewire fires an event and Alpine acts on that event.
- Autocomplete with Alpine v3
